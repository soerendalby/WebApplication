# Contracts for Car Booking System

This feature currently has no external API in the MVP (as stated in the spec), so no OpenAPI/GraphQL contracts are generated.

What is included now:
- CSV export contract for the Audit Log (columns, types, order)

What will be added later (optional):
- REST/OpenAPI endpoints if an API is introduced in a subsequent phase
- Event contracts (domain events) if we add integrations

See: ../spec.md (FR-060..FR-062, SC-005) for audit/export requirements.
